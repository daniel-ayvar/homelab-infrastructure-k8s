# rss-parser

This app hosts small HTTP endpoints that expose RSS feeds generated by custom
parsers.

## Why the code lives in this repo
The parser code is stored directly in this infrastructure repo and delivered via
a ConfigMap so it can be deployed quickly without a separate build pipeline.
This keeps the setup simple and makes small changes easy to ship.

## Future refactor
We plan to split the parser into its own repository and build a dedicated
container image. That will make dependency management and releases cleaner as
the parser set grows.
